Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{this should be in a new paragraph}The prominent pattern in Figure \ref{fig:lam1} is that many different \textsc{neg}+\textsc{have} combinations have been consistently attested across the eight texts, although the number of their occurrences were rather low. The forms \textit{wéi}-have, \textit{mò}-have, and \textit{fēi}-have serve as examples of this. There are four particular \textsc{neg}+\textsc{have} combinations that have displayed more substantial changes over time: \textit{wèi}-have (未有 \todo{Please make sure that these Chinese characters print}\textit{wèi-yǒu}), \textit{bù}-have (不有 \todo{Please make sure that these Chinese characters print} \textit{bù-yǒu}), \textit{wu2}-have (無有\todo{Please make sure that these Chinese characters print} \textit{wú-yǒu}), and \textit{mei2}-have (沒有 \todo{Please make sure that these Chinese characters print}\textit{méi-yǒu}), with the latter being the focus of this analysis. For clarity, these results are repeated in Figure \ref{fig:lam2} which uses the same design as Figure \ref{fig:lam1}. \todo{fig:lam2 should come immediately after this sentence}

Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints}\textit{mau} prevailed particularly in the southern varieties. By the late Tang dynasty (ca. tenth century AD), the M-negators dominated the southern part of China, while the P-negators remained popular in the North. The key stages are summarised in Table \ref{tab:lam6} below.  

Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints} \textit{méi}/\textit{mò} first appeared during the Pre-Qin era where it had three related meanings: to sink or submerge, to die, and the end of something, as illustrated in examples (\ref{ex:lam18}), (\ref{ex:lam19}), and (\ref{ex:lam20}), respectively. It is important to note that although these three readings of 沒\todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints} \textit{méi}/\textit{mò}  are archaic, they continue to be found in present-day Chinese, such as, in Mandarin and Cantonese. When this lexical item is used to express its three meanings in Beijing and Taiwan Mandarin, its phonological realisation is \textit{mò} (\textit{mut6} in Hong Kong Cantonese). Whereas, when it functions as a standard negator, it is realised as \textit{méi}. This function is not found in Cantonese but if it were, the phonological form would still be \textit{mut6}. For ease of exposition, I follow the pronunciation in contemporary Mandarin when glossing the lexical uses of this word as \textit{mò} and its negation uses as \textit{méi} in the examples and in the text. An important point to note, however, is that in terms of sound change, \textit{méi} did not develop from \textit{mò} (\citealt[390]{Schuessler2007}).

Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints} \textit{méi}/\textit{mò} is the negator, but this would be a misinterpretation. Similar to example (\ref{ex:lam19a}), this sentence contains two clauses with parallel structure, expressing a contrastive meaning: the first clause states that the person in question (although pro-dropped) attains remarkable achievements when he lives, and the second clause contrasts that by stating what he possesses when he dies. In both clauses, the verb \textit{yǒu} `have' means `to possess/own', and 沒\todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints} \textit{méi}/\textit{mò} in the second clause means `dead' (hence it is glossed as \textit{mò}, not \textit{méi}), the opposite of \textit{shēng} `live' in the first clause. 

Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{Please make sure that this Chinese character prints} \textit{méi} emerged (\ref{ex:lam21}), as did its use as a verbal negator (\ref{ex:lam22}). \citet{Xu2003} presents an alternative position that the emergence of \textit{méi} could be phonologically-driven. According to \citeauthor{Xu2003}, sound change occurred approximately during the tenth century AD making \textit{wú} (\textit{mou4} in Hong Kong Cantonese, which resembles the Middle Chinese realisation more closely) and \textit{mò} almost indistinguishable phonetically. As a result, by the Song dynasty (AD 960–1279), \textit{mò} and \textit{wù} tended to be used interchangeably, and by around the fifteenth century, \textit{méi}/\textit{mò} has completely replaced \textit{wú} as the negative existential (see \citealt{PanW2002} and \citealt{Xu2003}). In fact, the semantic bleaching and sound change accounts fit rather well in terms of timing and the empirical evidence, and it is likely that both factors contributed and motivated the rise of \textit{méi}/\textit{mò} as the new negative existential predicate. This special form for the negative existential later developed into a standard negator in contemporary Mandarin varieties, confirming the NEC prediction. \citet[376--377, 517--518]{Schuessler2007} mentions that two possible pathways have been proposed. On the one hand, \citet[126]{Norman1988} suggests that \textit{méi} (which was pronounced muət in Middle Chinese) could be a variant of 勿 \textit{wú} or 未\textit{wèi}, and that this variant was later fused with or influenced by \textit{yǒu} `have'. On the other hand, \citet[121]{Pulleyblank1973} proposes that the etymology of `not have' originated from `submerge'. It began from the reconstructed form *\textit{ma}, continued to 末 \textit{mò} `the end of something' and to 亡 \textit{wáng} (\textit{mong4} in Hong Kong Cantonese) `to die or be dead', then to 無 \textit{wú} (Hong Kong Cantonese \textit{mou4}) `not or nothing' or 莫 \textit{mò} `not or don't', and finally to 沒 \textit{mò}/\textit{méi} as `not have'. A thorough examination of which of the two factors played a more significant role in the historical development would, however, go beyond the scope of the present study. 

Lam_Chinese_290321.tex:todo{this should be a new paragraph}The historical development sketched in this section has important implications for the analysis of contemporary Mandarin negation. Firstly, the fact that \textit{méi} predates \textit{méiyǒu} in being a negative existential predicate and a verbal negator indicates that \textit{méi} cannot be interpreted as a contracted form of \textit{méiyǒu}. The optional presence of \textit{yǒu} in present-day Mandarin varieties is not simply a matter of phonological fusion or reduction in the fact that \textit{yǒu} can appear with \textit{méi} in negative existential contexts and standard negation indicates that the existential content of \textit{méi} may be bleached. This results in the presence of \textit{yǒu} being acceptable and not semantically redundant; and its optionality shows that the semantic bleaching remains underway. Secondly, the development of \textit{méi} from a negative existential predicate to verbal negation might explain why \textit{yǒu} must be negated by \textit{méi}, while other verbs can be negated by either \textit{méi} or \textit{bù}. The connection between \textit{méi} and \textit{yǒu} rests in their semantic connection, that is, existence. The next section will examine the negation system of two Cantonese varieties (Hong Kong and Gaozhou Cantonese) from the perspective of the NEC. The result will not only highlight the cross-linguistic similarities and differences, but will also account for the ambiguous statuses of \textit{wú-yǒu} and \textit{méi-yǒu}.

Oreal_AncientEgyptian-2.tex:todo{the special characters should be re-checked; see Elsa's pdf} also used in positive modal main clauses by insubordination may indeed be considered to derive from a need for emphasis. Such an explanation would account for its gradual replacing of the more ancient modal construction based on the negation \textit{ni} and a nominalization. However, as seen in Section \ref{s:AE2}, there is a gap in the attestation of the spoken register in Earlier Egyptian that allows for an unattested intermediary step *\textit{ni wn} subjunctive \textit{sDm-f}. In that case, the construction using the dedicated negative existential \textit{nn} would be inherited, deriving from a former construction involving the existential verb and the Standard Negation. As a consequence, it would seem questionable to speak of the negative existential extending to Standard Negation.\footnote{In such cases, \citet{Veselinova2014} states that the cycle is not operational.}
